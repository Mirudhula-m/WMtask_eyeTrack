# WMtask_eyeTrack

A working memory online/remote behavior task. 

An additional component for tracking subject eyes was added so that the the trials won't start unless subjects keep their eyes fixated at the center of the screen.

Tracking eyes during training/testing of experiments remotely is a huge issue since there is no one to physically correct the subject behavior. This task was written with the aim of getting good results while making sure subjects remain focussed during tasks.
